## 1. Introduction and Foundations

### 1.1 What is the Mayan Calendar?

The Mayan Dreamspell Calendar (also known as the Galactic Calendar) is a modern interpretation of the ancient Maya Tzolkin calendar, developed by Dr. José Argüelles and Lloydine Argüelles in 1987. It combines:

- **260-day Tzolkin cycle**: Sacred calendar combining 20 solar seals with 13 galactic tones
- **13-Moon Calendar**: 13 months of 28 days each (364 days) plus 1 Day Out of Time
- **Dreamspell synchronization**: Aligned with July 26th as New Year's Day

**Important Distinction**: The Dreamspell is NOT the traditional Mayan calendar. It is a modern adaptation inspired by Maya wisdom but created specifically for contemporary use. Traditional Mayan calendar (Cholq'ij) is still used by Maya communities in Guatemala and follows different calculations.

### 1.2 The Sacred 13:20 Ratio

The entire system is based on the harmonic ratio **13:20**:
- **13**: Represents the 13 galactic tones (creative stages)
- **20**: Represents the 20 solar seals (archetypal energies)

This ratio generates: 13 × 20 = 260 possible unique combinations (Kins)

### 1.3 Key Characteristics

- **Cycle length**: 260 days (one "galactic spin")
- **52-year synchronization**: Every date repeats every 52 years exactly
- **Leap day handling**: February 29th is "Day Out of Time" (0.0 Hunab Ku) - not counted in Tzolkin
- **New Year**: July 26th each year
- **Perfect harmony**: Mathematical system called "synchronic order"

---

## 2. Main Components

### 2.1 The 20 Solar Seals (Sellos Solares)

These represent archetypal energies, one for each day of the 20-day cycle. Each has a color, power, action, and essence.

| # | Name (English) | Name (Spanish) | Color | Power | Action | Essence |
|---|----------------|------------------|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Dragon | Dragón | Red | Birth | Nurtures | Being |
| 2 | Wind | Viento | White | Spirit | Communicates | Breath |
| 3 | Night | Noche | Blue | Abundance | Dreams | Intuition |
| 4 | Seed | Semilla | Yellow | Flowering | Targets | Awareness |
| 5 | Serpent | Serpiente | Red | Life Force | Survives | Instinct |
| 6 | World-Bridger | Puente del Mundo | White | Death | Equalizes | Opportunity |
| 7 | Hand | Mano | Blue | Accomplishment | Knows | Healing |
| 8 | Star | Estrella | Yellow | Elegance | Beautifies | Art |
| 9 | Moon | Luna | Red | Universal Water | Purifies | Flow |
| 10 | Dog | Perro | White | Heart | Loves | Loyalty |
| 11 | Monkey | Mono | Blue | Magic | Plays | Illusion |
| 12 | Human | Humano | Yellow | Free Will | Influences | Wisdom |
| 13 | Skywalker | Caminante del Cielo | Red | Space | Explores | Wakefulness |
| 14 | Wizard | Mago | White | Timelessness | Enchants | Receptivity |
| 15 | Eagle | Águila | Blue | Vision | Creates | Mind |
| 16 | Warrior | Guerrero | Yellow | Intelligence | Questions | Fearlessness |
| 17 | Earth | Tierra | Red | Navigation | Evolves | Synchronicity |
| 18 | Mirror | Espejo | White | Endlessness | Reflects | Order |
| 19 | Storm | Tormenta | Blue | Self-generation | Catalyzes | Energy |
| 20 | Sun | Sol | Yellow | Universal Fire | Enlightens | Life |

**Color Sequence**: Red → White → Blue → Yellow (repeats)

### 2.2 The 13 Galactic Tones (Tonos Galácticos)

These represent the stages of creation, forming a wave pattern from unity to transcendence.

| # | Name | Essence | Power | Action |
|---|------|---------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Magnetic | Purpose | Unify | Attract |
| 2 | Lunar | Challenge | Polarize | Stabilize |
| 3 | Electric | Service | Activate | Bond |
| 4 | Self-Existing | Form | Define | Measure |
| 5 | Overtone | Radiance | Empower | Command |
| 6 | Rhythmic | Equality | Organize | Balance |
| 7 | Resonant | Attunement | Channel | Inspire |
| 8 | Galactic | Integrity | Harmonize | Model |
| 9 | Solar | Intention | Pulse | Realize |
| 10 | Planetary | Manifestation | Perfect | Produce |
| 11 | Spectral | Liberation | Dissolve | Release |
| 12 | Crystal | Cooperation | Dedicate | Universalize |
| 13 | Cosmic | Presence | Endure | Transcend |

### 2.3 The 260 Kines

Each Kin is a unique combination of **one Solar Seal** (1-20) and **one Galactic Tone** (1-13).

**Format**: `[Color] [Tone Name] [Seal Name]`

Examples:
- Kin 1: Red Magnetic Dragon (Tone 1 + Seal 1)
- Kin 2: White Lunar Wind (Tone 2 + Seal 2)
- Kin 13: Blue Cosmic Night (Tone 13 + Seal 3)
- Kin 14: Yellow Magnetic Seed (Tone 1 + Seal 4)
- Kin 260: Yellow Cosmic Sun (Tone 13 + Seal 20)

**Kin Number**: Always 1-260, calculated as a continuous count through the matrix.

## 3. Color System

### 3.1 Four Colors and Their Meanings

| Color | Element | Direction | Function | Family |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Red | Earth (Tierra) | East (Este) | Initiate | Cardinal (Cardinal) |
| White | Air (Aire) | North (Norte) | Refine | Cardinal (Cardinal) |
| Blue | Water (Agua) | West (Oeste) | Transform | Cardinal (Cardinal) |
| Yellow | Fire (Fuego) | South (Sur) | Mature | Cardinal (Cardinal) |

### 3.2 Color Sequence Pattern

The colors always follow this repeating sequence: **Red → White → Blue → Yellow → Red...**

This sequence applies to:
- Solar Seals (4 cycles of 5 seals each)
- Galactic Tones (4 cycles: 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13)
- All energy relationships in the Oracle

### 3.3 Color Relationships

- **Same Color**: Reinforces and amplifies energy
- **Opposite Colors**:
  - Red ↔ Blue (East ↔ West)
  - White ↔ Yellow (North ↔ South)

---

## 4. Kin Calculation from Gregorian Date

### 4.1 Reference Point

**Critical Date**: July 26, 1987 = Red Magnetic Dragon (Kin 1)

This is the synchronization point for the Dreamspell calendar. The Tzolkin cycle aligns with the Gregorian calendar such that July 26th is always the start of a new Mayan year.

### 4.2 Leap Day Handling (February 29th)

**February 29th is NOT counted in the Tzolkin calculation**. It is called "Day Out of Time" or "0.0 Hunab Ku" and is completely ignored when calculating the Kin number.

This means:
- February 28th and March 1st have the SAME Kin
- The Tzolkin count does not advance on February 29th

### 4.3 Calculation Algorithm

To calculate the Kin for any Gregorian date:

#### Step 1: Calculate days from reference point

```python
# Reference: July 26, 1987 = Kin 1
# Note: February 29th is skipped in day count

def calculate_kin_number(date):
    """
    Calculate Kin number (1-260) from Gregorian date.
    Args:
        date: datetime object
    Returns:
        int: Kin number (1-260)
    """
    reference_date = datetime(1987, 7, 26)  # July 26, 1987
    date_to_calculate = date
    
    # Calculate total days from reference
    total_days = (date_to_calculate - reference_date).days
    
    # Subtract leap days (February 29th) from reference date
    leap_days = count_leap_days_between(reference_date, date_to_calculate)
    total_days -= leap_days
    
    # Ensure positive number
    while total_days < 0:
        total_days += 260
    
    # Calculate position in 260-day cycle
    kin_position = (total_days % 260) + 1
    
    return kin_position

def count_leap_days_between(start_date, end_date):
    """Count February 29th dates between two dates (exclusive)."""
    leap_days = 0
    year = start_date.year + 1
    
    while year < end_date.year or (year == end_date.year and month < 3):
        if is_leap_year(year):
            leap_day = datetime(year, 2, 29)
            if start_date < leap_day < end_date:
                leap_days += 1
        year += 1
    
    return leap_days
```

#### Step 2: Calculate Galactic Tone (1-13)

```python
def calculate_tone(kin_number):
    """
    Calculate Galactic Tone (1-13) from Kin number.
    Formula: ((kin_number - 1) % 13) + 1
    """
    return ((kin_number - 1) % 13) + 1
```

#### Step 3: Calculate Solar Seal (1-20)

```python
def calculate_seal(kin_number):
    """
    Calculate Solar Seal (1-20) from Kin number.
    Formula: ((kin_number - 1) % 20) + 1
    """
    return ((kin_number - 1) % 20) + 1
```

#### Step 4: Get Color

```python
def get_color_from_seal(seal_number):
    """
    Get color from seal number (1-20).
    Sequence: Red, White, Blue, Yellow (repeats every 4)
    """
    color_index = (seal_number - 1) % 4
    colors = ["Red", "White", "Blue", "Yellow"]
    return colors[color_index]
```

#### Step 5: Calculate Year Kin (Mayan Year)

The Mayan Year is determined by the Kin of July 26th of the previous year.

```python
def calculate_year_kin(date):
    """
    Calculate the Year Kin based on July 26th of previous year.
    """
    # July 26th is the New Year
    if date.month > 7 or (date.month == 7 and date.day >= 26):
        # After July 26th, use this year's July 26th
        new_year_date = datetime(date.year, 7, 26)
    else:
        # Before July 26th, use previous year's July 26th
        new_year_date = datetime(date.year - 1, 7, 26)
    
    return calculate_kin_number(new_year_date)
```

### 4.4 Complete Calculation Example

**Date**: January 7, 2026 (today)

```python
# Step 1: Calculate days from reference (July 26, 1987)
# Days from July 26, 1987 to January 7, 2026 = 14,107 days
# Leap days in that period: 10 (1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024)
# Adjusted days: 14,107 - 10 = 14,097 days

# Step 2: Position in 260-day cycle
# 14,097 % 260 = 97
# Kin number = 97 + 1 = 98

# Step 3: Galactic Tone
# ((98 - 1) % 13) + 1 = ((97 % 13) + 1) = (6 + 1) = 7
# Tone 7 = Resonant

# Step 4: Solar Seal
# ((98 - 1) % 20) + 1 = ((97 % 20) + 1) = (17 + 1) = 18
# Seal 18 = Mirror

# Step 5: Color
# (18 - 1) % 4 = 17 % 4 = 1
# Color index 1 = White

# Result: White Resonant Mirror (Kin 98)
```

## 5. Wavespell (Onda Encantada)

### 5.1 Definition

A Wavespell is a 13-day cycle representing a complete creative process. Each Wavespell is governed by a specific Solar Seal and contains 13 Kins, one for each Galactic Tone.

### 5.2 Wavespell Structure

Every Wavespell contains exactly one Kin of each Galactic Tone (1-13).

**Pattern**:
- Day 1 (Tone 1): Initiates the Wavespell - **Starts a new Wavespell**
- Days 2-12 (Tones 2-12): Develop the creative process
- Day 13 (Tone 13): Completes the Wavespell

### 5.3 Identifying a Wavespell

To find which Wavespell a Kin belongs to:

```python
def calculate_wavespell_start(kin_number):
    """
    Find the first Kin of the Wavespell that contains this Kin.
    Formula: Find the most recent Kin with Tone 1.
    """
    # Tone 1 Kins are at positions: 1, 14, 27, 40, 53, ... in the 260-day cycle
    # Formula: ((kin_number - 1) // 13) * 13 + 1
    
    wavespell_start = ((kin_number - 1) // 13) * 13 + 1
    return wavespell_start

def get_wavespell_kins(kin_number):
    """
    Get all 13 Kins in the Wavespell.
    """
    start_kin = calculate_wavespell_start(kin_number)
    return list(range(start_kin, start_kin + 13))
```

### 5.4 Wavespell Tone Meanings

| Position | Tone | Name | Purpose in Wavespell |
|----------|------|------|---------------------|
| 1 | 1 | Magnetic | Purpose - What are you here to do? |
| 2 | 2 | Lunar | Challenge - What obstacles will you face? |
| 3 | 3 | Electric | Service - How can you serve? |
| 4 | 4 | Self-Existing | Form - What structure is needed? |
| 5 | 5 | Overtone | Radiance - How do you empower? |
| 6 | 6 | Rhythmic | Equality - How do you balance? |
| 7 | 7 | Resonant | Attunement - How do you attune? |
| 8 | 8 | Galactic | Integrity - How do you harmonize? |
| 9 | 9 | Solar | Intention - How do you pulse intention? |
| 10 | 10 | Planetary | Manifestation - What do you manifest? |
| 11 | 11 | Spectral | Liberation - What do you release? |
| 12 | 12 | Crystal | Cooperation - How do you cooperate? |
| 13 | 13 | Cosmic | Transcend - How do you transcend? |

### 5.5 Birth Wavespell

A person's Birth Wavespell is the 13-day Wavespell containing their birth Kin. This represents:
- **Position in Wavespell**: Your mission and how you accomplish your purpose
- **First Kin of Wavespell**: Your life purpose
- **All 13 Kins**: Life companions and their messages

---

## 6. Kin Oracle

### 6.1 Oracle Structure

Each Kin has five complementary energies that form an "Oracle" or "Medicine Wheel".

```
        Guide (above)
        ║════════║
        ║  Color  ║
        ║        ║
  Analog  ║ Destiny  ║  Antipode
  (right)  ║   Kin   ║   (left)
           ║ (center)║
           ║        ║
           ║  Color  ║
           ║        ║
           ║ Occult ║
          (below)
```

### 6.2 The Five Oracle Energies

#### Destiny Kin (Center)
- **Description**: Your main energy, birth sign, who you are and who you're becoming
- **Color**: Can be Red, White, Blue, or Yellow
- **Calculation**: This is the Kin itself

#### Guide Power (Above)
- **Description**: Shows you the way, higher guidance
- **Color**: **ALWAYS the same color as Destiny Kin**
- **Calculation**: `((Destiny Tone + 12) % 13) + 1` for tone, same seal as Destiny
- **Special Cases**: When Destiny Tone is 1, 6, or 11, the Guide is the SAME as Destiny Kin (reinforces own energy)

#### Analog (Right)
- **Description**: Compatible energy, support, what comes naturally
- **Color**: Next color in sequence from Destiny (if Destiny is Red, Analog is White)
- **Calculation**: 
  - Tone: Same as Destiny Tone
  - Seal: `(Destiny Seal + 7) % 20 + 1`

#### Antipode (Left)
- **Description**: Challenge, life lesson, what strengthens you through opposition
- **Color**: Opposite color of Destiny (Red ↔ Blue, White ↔ Yellow)
- **Calculation**:
  - Tone: Same as Destiny Tone
  - Seal: `(Destiny Seal + 10) % 20 + 1`

#### Occult/Hidden Power (Below)
- **Description**: Hidden power, unexpected gifts, subconscious influence
- **Color**: Color opposite to Destiny's color
- **Calculation**:
  - Tone: `(14 - Destiny Tone)` (complementary tone to 13)
  - Seal: `(Destiny Seal + 12) % 20 + 1`

### 6.3 Oracle Calculation Algorithm

```python
def calculate_oracle(kin_number):
    """
    Calculate all 5 Oracle energies for a Kin.
    Returns dictionary with Destiny, Guide, Analog, Antipode, Occult.
    """
    destiny_tone = calculate_tone(kin_number)
    destiny_seal = calculate_seal(kin_number)
    destiny_color = get_color_from_seal(destiny_seal)
    
    # Guide (above) - same color as Destiny
    guide_tone = ((destiny_tone + 12) % 13) + 1  # Complementary tone
    # Special case: tones 1, 6, 11 have same guide as destiny
    if destiny_tone in [1, 6, 11]:
        guide_tone = destiny_tone
    guide_seal = destiny_seal
    guide_color = destiny_color
    
    # Analog (right) - next color in sequence
    analog_tone = destiny_tone
    analog_seal = (destiny_seal + 7) % 20 + 1
    analog_color = get_color_from_seal(analog_seal)
    
    # Antipode (left) - opposite color
    antipode_tone = destiny_tone
    antipode_seal = (destiny_seal + 10) % 20 + 1
    antipode_color = get_color_from_seal(antipode_seal)
    
    # Occult (below) - opposite color, complementary tone
    occult_tone = 14 - destiny_tone  # Complementary tone (if tone is 1, occult is 13)
    occult_seal = (destiny_seal + 12) % 20 + 1
    occult_color = get_color_from_seal(occult_seal)
    
    return {
        "destiny": {"kin": kin_number, "tone": destiny_tone, "seal": destiny_seal, "color": destiny_color},
        "guide": {"tone": guide_tone, "seal": guide_seal, "color": guide_color},
        "analog": {"tone": analog_tone, "seal": analog_seal, "color": analog_color},
        "antipode": {"tone": antipode_tone, "seal": antipode_seal, "color": antipode_color},
        "occult": {"tone": occult_tone, "seal": occult_seal, "color": occult_color}
    }
```

### 6.4 Oracle Example

**Kin**: White Resonant Mirror (Kin 98)
- Destiny: White Resonant Mirror (Tone 7, Seal 18)
- Guide: White Resonant Mirror (Tone 7, Seal 18) - Same because Tone 7 is not 1, 6, or 11
- Analog: White Resonant Hand (Tone 7, Seal 7)
- Antipode: Yellow Resonant Star (Tone 7, Seal 8)
- Occult: Red Lunar Warrior (Tone 7, Seal 16)

## 7. Castles

### 7.1 Definition

Castles are 52-day cycles containing 4 Wavespells each. There are 5 Castles in the 260-day Tzolkin cycle.

### 7.2 The 5 Castles

| Castle | Color | Number | Kins | Wavespells |
|--------|-------|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Red | Red | 1-52 | Dragon, Wind, Night, Seed |
| 2 | White | White | 53-104 | Serpent, World-Bridger, Hand, Star |
| 3 | Blue | Blue | 105-156 | Moon, Dog, Monkey, Human |
| 4 | Yellow | Yellow | 157-208 | Skywalker, Wizard, Eagle, Warrior |
| 5 | Red | Red | 209-260 | Earth, Mirror, Storm, Sun |

### 7.3 Identifying a Castle

```python
def get_castle(kin_number):
    """
    Get Castle number (1-5) and color for a Kin.
    """
    castle_number = ((kin_number - 1) // 52) + 1
    
    colors = ["Red", "White", "Blue", "Yellow", "Red"]
    castle_color = colors[castle_number - 1]
    
    return {"number": castle_number, "color": castle_color}
```

### 7.4 Castle Characteristics

- **Each Castle**: Contains exactly 52 Kins (4 Wavespells × 13 days)
- **Castle starts**: When a Red Seal has Tone 1 (starts new Castle AND new Wavespell)
- **Castle ends**: When Tone 13 is reached (completes 4th Wavespell of Castle)

---

## 8. GAP Days (Galactic Activation Portals)

### 8.1 Definition

GAP Days are specific days in the Tzolkin matrix where energy is more potent. These form a pattern called the "Loom of Maya" or "Portal Days."

### 8.2 GAP Pattern

There are **52 GAP Days** distributed in a specific pattern across the 260-day cycle.

**Gap Kins** (bold): Every 4th Kin in the sequence, but with specific positions:

The pattern repeats every 52 Kins:
- Position pattern: 4, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51

**Note**: These are NOT every 4th Kin - the pattern has gaps.

### 8.3 GAP Calculation

```python
def is_gap_kin(kin_number):
    """
    Determine if a Kin is a Galactic Activation Portal (GAP).
    Based on the Loom of Maya pattern.
    """
    # Define the GAP pattern within a 52-Kin cycle
    gap_positions_in_cycle = [
        4, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
        30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43,
        44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51
    ]
    
    position_in_cycle = ((kin_number - 1) % 52) + 1
    return position_in_cycle in gap_positions_in_cycle
```

### 8.4 Core Days (Mystic Column)

**Column 7** of the Tzolkin matrix is the "Mystic Column" or "Core Column."

These are the Kins: 7, 20, 33, 46, 59, 72, 85, 98, 111, 124, 137, 150, 163, 176, 189, 202, 215, 228, 241, 254

```python
def is_core_day(kin_number):
    """
    Determine if a Kin is a Core Day (Mystic Column, Column 7).
    """
    # Core days are every 13th Kin starting from Kin 7
    return (kin_number - 7) % 13 == 0
```

## 10. Practical Examples

### 10.1 Example 1: Today's Date (January 7, 2026)

```python
calculator = MayanCalculator()
today = datetime(2026, 1, 7)
details = calculator.get_kin_details(today)

# Results:
{
    "date": "2026-01-07",
    "kin_number": 98,
    "kin_name": "White Resonant Mirror",
    "tone": 7,
    "seal": 18,
    "color": "White",
    
    "oracle": {
        "destiny": {"tone": 7, "seal": 18, "color": "White"},
        "guide": {"tone": 7, "seal": 18, "color": "White"},  # Same because Tone 7
        "analog": {"tone": 7, "seal": 7, "color": "Blue"},  # Blue Hand
        "antipode": {"tone": 7, "seal": 8, "color": "Yellow"},  # Yellow Star
        "occult": {"tone": 7, "seal": 16, "color": "Red"}  # Red Warrior
    },
    
    "wavespell": {
        "start_kin": 86,
        "end_kin": 98,
        "seal": 6,
        "color": "Blue",
        "position": 13,
        "kins": [86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98]
    },
    
    "castle": {
        "number": 2,
        "color": "White",
        "start_kin": 53,
        "end_kin": 104
    },
    
    "is_gap": False,
    "is_core_day": True  # Kin 98 = 98 - 7 = 91, 91 % 13 = 0
}
```

### 10.2 Example 2: February 29th (Leap Day)

```python
# February 29, 2024
date1 = datetime(2024, 2, 29)
date2 = datetime(2024, 3, 1)

kin1 = calculator.calculate_kin_number(date1)  # February 29th
kin2 = calculator.calculate_kin_number(date2)  # March 1st

# Both return the SAME Kin number
# Because February 29th is "Day Out of Time" and not counted
```

### 10.3 Example 3: July 26th (New Year)

```python
# July 26, 2025 (New Year)
new_year = datetime(2025, 7, 26)
new_year_kin = calculator.calculate_kin_number(new_year)

# This determines the Year Kin for the period
# July 26, 2025 to July 25, 2026

# July 25, 2026 (Day Out of Time)
day_out_of_time = datetime(2026, 7, 25)
day_out_kin = calculator.calculate_kin_number(day_out_of_time)

# July 26, 2026 (New Year 2026)
next_new_year = datetime(2026, 7, 26)
next_new_year_kin = calculator.calculate_kin_number(next_new_year)

# July 25th and July 26th have DIFFERENT Kins
# Because July 26th starts a new Mayan year
```

### 10.4 Example 4: Complete Birth Chart

**Birth Date**: March 15, 1990

```python
birth_date = datetime(1990, 3, 15)
birth_details = calculator.get_kin_details(birth_date)

# Results:
{
    "kin_number": 60,
    "kin_name": "Yellow Rhythmic Human",
    
    "wavespell": {
        "start_kin": 48,
        "seal": 8,  # Yellow Star Wavespell
        "position": 13
    },
    
    "castle": {
        "number": 2,
        "color": "White"
    }
}

# Birth Wavespell: Yellow Star Wavespell (Kins 48-60)
# Position in Wavespell: 13 (Cosmic) - The completion point
```

## 11. Interpretation and Usage

### 11.1 Interpreting a Personal Kin

**Destiny Kin (Your Sign)**
- Represents your core essence and what you're here to do
- Think of it as your "main energy" or "signature"
- Combines a Solar Seal (what you are) with a Galactic Tone (how you express it)

**Guide Power**
- Shows you the way, provides higher guidance
- When same as Destiny (tones 1, 6, 11): Reinforces your own energy
- Always same color as Destiny

**Analog**
- Natural support, what comes easily
- Often indicates fun, compatible energy
- Think of it as your "best friend" energy

**Antipode**
- Challenge or life lesson
- Strengthens you through opposition
- Not "bad" - it's what helps you grow

**Occult**
- Hidden power, unexpected gifts
- Subconscious influence
- Can manifest in surprising ways

### 11.2 Working with Your Birth Wavespell

Your Birth Wavespell is a 13-day cycle representing:
- **Tone 1 Kin**: Your Life Purpose
- **Your Birth Tone position**: Your Mission and how you accomplish your purpose
- **All 13 Kins**: Life companions, each with a message

**Practical Use**:
1. Track when your Birth Wavespell starts each 260-day cycle
2. Use the 13-tone pattern as a guide for any project or life phase
3. Each tone represents a stage of the creative process

### 11.3 Daily Energy Work

**Morning Ritual**:
1. Check today's Kin and Oracle
2. Read the daily message for the Kin
3. Meditate on the energies
4. Notice the Guide energy
5. Open to insights and synchronicities

**Planning**:
- Start important projects on Tone 1 days (Magnetic)
- Complete projects on Tone 13 days (Cosmic)
- Use Tone 2 (Lunar) days to identify challenges
- Use Tone 3 (Electric) days for service and connection

### 11.4 Special Days

**GAP Days**:
- Energy is more potent
- Good for initiation and activation
- Pay attention to synchronicities

**Core Days (Mystic Column)**:
- Deep mystical energy
- Good for meditation and inner work
- Connect with the core of your being

**Day Out of Time (July 25th)**:
- Not part of any month or week
- Not a Kin (not one of the 260)
- Day of celebration, art, meditation
- Prepare for New Year (July 26th)

### 12.4 Important Clarifications

**Dreamspell vs. Traditional Mayan Calendar**:
- Dreamspell: Modern interpretation, July 26th New Year, 28-day months
- Traditional (Cholq'ij): Indigenous calendar, different correlation with Gregorian
- Both use 13:20 ratio but different synchronization
- Dreamspell is NOT "The Mayan Calendar" - it's inspired by Maya wisdom

**Attribution Requirements**:
- Must attribute to Mayan Tzolkin calendar system
- Must attribute to Dreamspell system of José Argüelles (if using his interpretations)
- Respect both traditional Maya and modern Dreamspell traditions

## Appendix B: Implementation Notes for Development

### B.1 Database Schema Considerations

**Kins Table**:
- kin_number (1-260, unique)
- tone (1-13)
- seal (1-20)
- color (Red/White/Blue/Yellow)
- kin_name (full name)
- is_gap (boolean)
- is_core_day (boolean)

**Oracle Relationships Table**:
- destiny_kin (FK to kins)
- guide_kin (FK to kins)
- analog_kin (FK to kins)
- antipode_kin (FK to kins)
- occult_kin (FK to kins)

**Wavespells Table**:
- wavespell_id (1-20)
- start_kin (FK to kins)
- end_kin (FK to kins)
- governing_seal (1-20)

**Castles Table**:
- castle_number (1-5)
- color
- start_kin (FK to kins)
- end_kin (FK to kins)

### B.2 API Endpoints Needed

1. `GET /api/kin/{date}` - Get Kin for specific date
2. `GET /api/kin/{kin_number}` - Get Kin details by number
3. `GET /api/oracle/{kin_number}` - Get Oracle for a Kin
4. `GET /api/wavespell/{kin_number}` - Get Wavespell info
5. `GET /api/castle/{kin_number}` - Get Castle info
6. `GET /api/today` - Get today's Kin
7. `GET /api/year/{year}` - Get Year Kin
8. `GET /api/dates/{start}/{end}` - Get Kins for date range

### B.3 Caching Strategy

- Cache all 260 Kins in memory (small dataset)
- Pre-calculate Oracle relationships
- Pre-calculate Wavespell and Castle memberships
- Cache GAP and Core Day flags
- No need for database queries for Kin calculations (can be pure functions)

### B.4 Testing Data

**Test Dates to Verify**:
- July 26, 1987 → Kin 1 (Red Magnetic Dragon)
- January 1, 2000 → Verify with online calculators
- February 29, 2004 → Should match March 1, 2004
- July 26, 2025 → Should be year start
- July 25, 2026 → Day Out of Time
- July 26, 2026 → New year, different Kin

**Test Cases**:
1. Verify Kin number calculation (1-260)
2. Verify Tone calculation (1-13)
3. Verify Seal calculation (1-20)
4. Verify Oracle calculations (5 energies)
5. Verify Wavespell calculations
6. Verify Castle calculations
7. Verify GAP detection
8. Verify Core Day detection
9. Verify leap day handling
10. Verify year boundary (July 26th)
